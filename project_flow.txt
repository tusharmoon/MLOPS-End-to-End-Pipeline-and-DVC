***** Stage 1: Building Pipeline:*********************
1> Create a GitHub repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
2> Add src folder along with all components(run them individually).
3> Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4> Now git add, commit, push

**** Stage 2: From above stages you cannot just run each and ever module individually, so we can use dvc.yaml file to run these modules****

Setting up dcv pipeline (without params)
5> Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
6> dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
7> Now git add, commit, push

*** Stage 3: Creating a params.yaml file for getting parameters from a specific file****

Setting up dcv pipeline (with params)
8> add params.yaml file
9> Add the params setup (mentioned below)
10> Do "dvc repro" again to test the pipeline along with the params
11> Now git add, commit, push
